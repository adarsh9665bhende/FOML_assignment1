# Project Readme

This project consists of multiple problems, each with its own set of instructions and data. Follow the steps below to run the code for each problem.

## Problem 1

- File 'P1' is a notebook for this problem.
- Data is present in the 'data_p1' directory for this problem.
- Each cell of the notebook can be run one by one.
- The reasons for the selected model and features are explained in text form within the notebook.

## Problem 2

- File 'P2' contains the solution for parts A and B.
- File 'P2_c' contains the code for part C.
- Data is present in the 'winequality-red' and 'winequality-white' directories.
- The code is initially executed for the 'winequality-red' data.
- To run the code for 'winequality-white' data, change (link = "./winequality-red.csv") to (link = "./winequality-white.csv") in line number 10 of cell number 1, and then run each cell of the notebook one by one.

## Problem 3

- File 'P3' contains the solution for all parts of Problem 3.

## Problem 4
